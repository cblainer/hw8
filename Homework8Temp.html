<h1>Homework 8: Choropleth with Ratio: Categorized by Quantile, Equal Interval, and Natural Breaks  </h1>
<h2>Christian Rasnake</h2>
<h3>The ratio I formulated for this assignment was the percentage of people over age 25 in Florida with an educational attainment of a Bachelor’s Degree or higher. To make this ratio, I used the census data of the educational levels for all of the counties in Florida. The CSV file I originally downloaded with the census data also already had the population for each county, so I used this data to show the percentage of people over age 25 in Florida with a Bachelor’s Degree or higher.</h3>
